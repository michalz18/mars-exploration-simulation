# MARS EXPLORATION SIMULATION

 Our project is already deployed, you can see it here: 

## üåü Project aim

  

"Mars Exploration Simulation" is an advanced simulation application designed to assess the viability of Martian terrain for future human colonies. The application utilizes algorithms to generate a random map of Mars, populated with various terrain forms and resources. Simulated rovers traverse this map with the objective of scouting the landscape and gathering crucial data on the area's suitability for human habitation. These rovers not only explore but also have the capability to collect resources such as minerals and water, which are vital for the sustenance of any future colony. In addition to exploration, the rovers can establish temporary bases where collected resources and data are stored. All activities and findings are recorded in a log file for later analysis, making it an essential tool for anyone interested in the future of space exploration and Martian colonization.

## üìù To do

  

- Scenario-based Simulations: Introduce pre-defined mission scenarios that simulate specific challenges or conditions on Mars, like resource scarcity or equipment failure, to test the adaptability of the rovers and mission strategies.

- Additional Resources and Structures: Add more types of resources and structures that rovers can discover and utilize, to add depth and complexity to the simulation.

- Rover Upgrades: Implement a system for upgrading rovers with new tools or modules as the mission progresses, allowing for more specialized research capabilities.

- Environmental Interactions: Introduce dynamic environmental factors such as dust storms or temperature fluctuations that the rovers have to adapt to, adding another layer of realism and complexity to the simulations.

  

## ‚ú® Features

  

- Random Map Generation: Generates a randomized Martian map complete with various terrain forms and objects.

- Rover Exploration: Simulates rovers traversing the map to scout and gather data on the area's suitability for human habitation.

- Resource Collection: Rovers can collect crucial resources like minerals and water from the Martian surface.

- Base Building: Rovers have the ability to establish temporary bases where they can store collected resources and data.

- Log File Recording: All activities, discoveries, and findings are saved in a log file for subsequent analysis.

- Real-Time Notifications: Provides real-time updates or alerts based on the rover's findings or situations.
